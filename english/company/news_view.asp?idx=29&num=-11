                <td colspan="3" align="left" style="padding:5 10">Pantech Group (Chairman Park, Byeong-Yeop , www.pantech.com, www.curitel.com),  a specialized IT company that has been growing hand in hand with IT Korea, announced that it would participate in the 19th annual 'CeBIT 2004'  the largest information and telecommunication exhibition in the world to be held in Hannover, Germany from March 18 to 24. Pantech Group will introduce 31 state-of-the-art high-performing handset models including a two million-pixel camera phone, a mega-pixel camcorder phone that can save images for up to three hours, the longest in Korea, a fingerprint identification phone, a blue-tooth phone, and a pick-a-color chameleon phone, implementing full penetration into the European market to jump up to position of the 6th largest handset manufacturer in the world.<br>
<br>
Pantech exhibition pavilion is one of the most unique ones among many 'CeBIT 2004'participants. It located at the center of the CeBIT exhibition floor in the 25th hall over 198 square meters of space. The pavilion looks like a futuristic spaceship landing on an unknown world. It is a two-story building with an unprecedented and sophisticated state-of-the-art design. The first floor consists of diverse theme zones - an event space where visitors can experience 3D sound in Sound Zone and Camera Zone, and an event zone for instant picture-taking and printing, to the astonishment of the visitors.<br>
<br>
Targeting Europe, the home of GSM technology, Pantech Group plans to catch the eye of Europeans during the exhibition by introducing 13 practical, high-performing GSM phones in sophisticated European-style designs, including a fingerprint identification phone, a chameleon phone equipped with an FM radio receiver on which a user can change the case of the handset to present his/her own color, and a blue-tooth phone that can operate headsets through wireless remote controlling.<br>
<br>
 Especially, by exhibiting eight CDMA phones as well, such as a two million-pixel camera phone with the quality of a high-density digital camera, and a mega-pixel camcorder phone that can save three-hour long video images, the longest in Korea, Pantech Group demonstrates itself as a company with strong technological capability and product development capability in both GSM and CDMA technologies.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Pantech Group prepares a separate booth to exhibit CDMA450 phones ?which use 450Mhz frequency range and are increasing the number of subscribers in Russia and Rumania - and is implementing a massive marketing campaign by mobilizing its local Russian staff. Pantech Group will also introduce diverse new telecommunication technologies to audience as a technological leader by exhibiting a Wireless Local Loop (WLL) handset that provides perfect communication in the hinterlands such as jungles and mountains, and a 3G WCDMA concept phone that adopts the next-generation wireless communication technology.<br>
<br>
   Another characteristic of Pantech's products is the unique and sophisticated design. One design symbolizes an 멷cho,?and another depicts the charm of a beetle, a handset that looks like a game station, and a camcorder phone that reminds of a cute camcorder. These unique and nature-friendly concept phones, as well as a game phone equipped with an FM receiver that looks like the curve of a woman뭩 waistline, are winning the admiration and praise of buyers and audiences.<br>
<br>
During the last decade, Pantech Group has grown as the most noticeable specialized IT company in IT industry in Korea. In 2003, it launched the world's first CMOS-based mega-pixel camera phone (model name: PG-S5000) and a camera phone (model name: S2) that mounts the largest external window in the world. Pantech Group manufactured and sold 12 million sets of these uniquely designed high-tech GSM and CDMA products in the markets such as North America, China, and Russia, achieving 2trillion won of sales volume, and came to be ranked as the 8th largest handset manufacturer in the world.<br>
<br>
 In 2004, Pantech Group plans to develop about 100 new models for the global market and about 30 new models for the domestic market and provide about 20 million sets, becoming the 6th major handset manufacturer in the world. Especially, by fully entering the European market that is the largest value-added GSM market in the world, Pantech Group is expected to increase the supply of Korean-made handsets to the European market, together with Samsung that has entered the market before Pantech Group.<br>
Pantech Group will achieve over 3 trillion won of sales volume this year with only one product category of wireless handset.<br>
<br>
Starting with 'CeBIT 2004'its first overseas exhibition, Pantech Group plans to participate in several other large domestic and overseas exhibitions - Australia in April, Moscow in May, and China in October - to introduce its leading wireless telecommunication technology and quality to the world. At the same time, it plans to continuously implement aggressive overseas marketing campaigns to develop its PANTECH brands into a global brand.<br>
