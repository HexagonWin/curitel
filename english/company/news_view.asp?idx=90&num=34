                <td colspan="3" align="left" style="padding:5 10">SEOUL, October 31st, 2005: Pantech - South Korea’s second biggest mobile phone manufacturer - today signposted its intentions to further target the premium handset market in Russia, with the announcement of its sponsorship of Fashion Week in Moscow 2005, the keynote event in the Russian fashion industry calendar.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The move comes as part of a business development strategy by Pantech to increase its 8% share of the rapidly growing Russian premium handset market by developing close associations with landmark cultural events to boost the profile of the company’s brand throughout Russia. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The four Pantech Slim-Series models - the PG-1400, the PG-1500, the PG-3500 and the PG-3600 - were selected as the official handsets for the Fashion Week in Moscow and were showcased by the famed Russian fashion designer Alexander Terekhov to great public acclaim. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sang-Soo Lee, Vice President & CMO, Pantech Co., said: “Our relationship with Fashion Week in Moscow 2005 has given us an innovative platform from which to showcase our distinctive, advanced design concepts. It has also provided us with the opportunity to identify our brand with one of the more celebrated cultural events in Russia”.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
“We have ambitious plans for the expansion of our operations in Russia. We believe that our Slim-Series range offers the ideal choices for fashionable consumers in this market who are looking for slim, stylish yet durable handsets with exceptional functionality,” said Mr. Lee.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Pantech has increased its brand awareness and unit sales dramatically in Russia since entering the region last year. Data from German market research institute, GfK, based on research carried out in March 2005, shows that Pantech has built up aided brand awareness levels of 53% among Russian consumers, while unaided brand awareness levels of 10% also compare favorably with its competitors. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Pantech expects to sell more than 1.5 million handsets in Russia this year and aims to be one of the top five suppliers in the market in 2006. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
“In the design and production of mobile phones, as in fashion, a select few brands lead the market as the ultimate arbiters of style and innovation. Pantech is becoming increasingly identified as being one of those brands,” said Mr. Lee.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Pantech has been recognized on several occasions by industry peers for design and technology leadership. In 2005, Pantech received honors from both the iF Design Awards, from the German International Forum, and the international Red Dot Communications Design Awards<br>
